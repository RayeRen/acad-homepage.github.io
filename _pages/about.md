Hello everyone, welcome to my homepage! Good morning, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
I am a Research Assistant in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk//) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Zhe Wang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=walter-zhe-wang-cezhewang//) and [Prof. Dengbo He](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/dengbo-he). I received my master degree in [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn//) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Fan Yu](https://www.baidu.com/link?url=Fov8hSfLaPDQ8bdhpKv2Dq4Vdo1AvnibWXX0HnZl45Mnl9zWvRgpkaB6qnIOThfpm51qD0dy2d0Q5j40w4IcKBnFXNLq7aneEYs7TxerjF3&wd=&eqid=efadda3d00195d7000000006630b2f86) and [Prof. Xi Zhang](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhangxi.html//) in 2020. I received my B.Eng. degree in [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://meccol.dhu.edu.cn//) at Donghua University in 2017.

My research interest includes building control and autonomous vehicles. I have published 5 papers at the top international conferences and journals (Details are shown in [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LWC2XQEAAAAJ//)).
