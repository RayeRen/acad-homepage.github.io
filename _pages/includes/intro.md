I work at [Sea AI Lab](https://sail.sea.com/) <img src='./images/logo-sea-header-desktop.webp' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now, leading the audio team and doing some fundamental audio-related research. We are [hiring researchers and engineers](https://career.sea.com/position/427) to work on TTS, music generation, speech translation and audio-driven talking face generation. If interested, feel free to email me at [renyi@sea.com](mailto:renyi@sea.com).

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhao Zhou (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (谭旭)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (秦涛)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and ByteDance Scholars Program (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published more than 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
